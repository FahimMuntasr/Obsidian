## POEMS
### To Autumn by John Keats
```
Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness,
Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
Conspiring with him how to load and bless
With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
To bend with apples the moss’d cottage-trees,
And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
With a sweet kernel; to set budding more,
And still more, later flowers for the bees,
Until they think warm days will never cease,
For summer has o’er-brimm’d their clammy cells.

Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
Sometimes whoever seeks abroad may find
Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
Or on a half-reap’d furrow sound asleep,
Drows’d with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
And sometimes like a gleaner thou dost keep
Steady thy laden head across a brook;
Or by a cyder-press, with patient look,
Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.

Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?
Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,—
While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
Among the river sallows, borne aloft
Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
And full-grown lambs loud bleat from hilly bourn;
Hedge-crickets sing; and now with treble soft
The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
```
#### Themes
- **Mortality and immortality** : The theme of two opposing concepts, mortality and immortality, is presented through the eternal change of the seasons. Autumn never truly dies, as it returns each year. The immortality of the cycle of the seasons serves as a reminder of the mortality of humans.
- **Power of Nature** : Keats showcases the power of nature through its ability to sustain both human and animal life. Although not life-threatening as in pre-Industrial times, bad harvests were still a serious matter in early nineteenth-century Britain. The poet personifies autumn, a force of nature, using a reverent tone to describe it.
### Do not go gentle into that good night by Dylan Thomas
```
Do not go gentle into that good night,  
Old age should burn and rave at close of day;  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
Though wise men at their end know dark is right,  
Because their words had forked no lightning they  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
  
Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright  
Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,  
And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
  
Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight  
Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.  
  
And you, my father, there on the sad height,  
Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.  
Do not go gentle into that good night.  
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.
```
#### Themes
- **Life & Death** : The primary sentiment of “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” is that life is precious and should be fought for at every turn. The poem’s speaker offers insight into how to face death with dignity and ferocity rather than resignation, believing that people should “burn and rave” as they approach death.
- **Family and Grief** : In the final stanza, the poem becomes not only about death but about family and grief. The poem has switched from a universal message about facing death to an emotionally-charged message that is just as much about the speaker and his own grief as it is about those he addresses.
## SONNETS
### How Do I Love Thee? (Sonnet 43 by Elizabeth Barrett Browning)
```
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.  
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height  
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight  
For the ends of being and ideal grace.  
I love thee to the level of every day’s  
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.  
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.  
I love thee purely, as they turn from praise.  
I love thee with the passion put to use  
In my old griefs, and with my childhood’s faith.  
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose  
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,  
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,  
I shall but love thee better after death.

### When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes (Sonnet 29 By William Shakespeare)
```
When, in disgrace with fortune and men’s eyes,  
I all alone beweep my outcast state,  
And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,  
And look upon myself and curse my fate,  
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,  
Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,  
Desiring this man’s art and that man’s scope,  
With what I most enjoy contented least;  
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,  
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,  
(Like to the lark at break of day arising  
From sullen earth) sings hymns at heaven’s gate;  
       For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings  
       That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
```

### Sonnet 1 by Michael Madhushudan Dutta
```
I am not rich, nay, nor the future heir  
To sparkling gold or silver heaped on store;  
There is no marble blushing on my floor  
With thousand varied dies:—no gilded chair,  
No cushions, carpets that by riches are  
Brought from the Persian land, or Turkish shore;  
There is no menial waiting at my door  
Attentive to the knell: and all things rare,  
Born in remotest regions, that shine in  
And grace the rich-man's hall, are wanting here.  
These are not things that by blind Fate have been  
Allotted ever to the poor man's share:  
These are not things, these eyes have ever seen,  
Tho' their proud names have sounded in this ear!
```

## 1984 by George Orwell
### Backstory
The book talks about a possible scenario for the development of the world. After several wars and revolutions, the Earth was divided into 3 super states named Oceania, Eurasia, Eastasia. These states are in constant conflict with each other. Such never-ending conflicts are needed to distract the attention of the population from poor internal public management, terrible living conditions of the countries. More importantly, the existence of the conflict allows the government to fully control the inhabitants of the states.
### Character Analysis
- **Winston Smith** : A minor member of the ruling Party in near-future London, Winston Smith is a thin, frail, contemplative, intellectual, and fatalistic thirty-nine-year-old. Winston hates the totalitarian control and enforced repression that are characteristic of his government. He harbors revolutionary dreams.
- **Julia** : Winston’s lover, a beautiful dark-haired girl working in the Fiction Department at the Ministry of Truth. Julia enjoys sex and claims to have had affairs with many Party members. Julia is pragmatic and optimistic. Her rebellion against the Party is small and personal, for her own enjoyment, in contrast to Winston’s ideological motivation.
- **O’Brien** : A mysterious, powerful, and sophisticated member of the Inner Party whom Winston believes is also a member of the Brotherhood, the legendary group of anti-Party rebels.
- **Big Brother** : Though he never appears in the novel, and though he may not actually exist, Big Brother, the perceived ruler of Oceania, is an extremely important figure. Everywhere Winston looks he sees posters of Big Brother’s face bearing the message “BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU.” Big Brother’s image is stamped on coins and broadcast on the unavoidable telescreens; it haunts Winston’s life and fills him with hatred and fascination.
- **Mr. Charrington** : An old man who runs a secondhand store in the prole district. Kindly and encouraging, Mr. Charrington seems to share Winston’s interest in the past. He also seems to support Winston’s rebellion against the Party and his relationship with Julia, since he rents Winston a room without a telescreen in which to carry out his affair. But Mr. Charrington is not as he seems. He is a member of the Thought Police.
- **Emmanuel Goldstein** : Another figure who exerts an influence on the novel without ever appearing in it. According to the Party, Goldstein is the legendary leader of the Brotherhood. He seems to have been a Party leader who fell out of favor with the regime. In any case, the Party describes him as the most dangerous and treacherous man in Oceania.
### Themes

Their relationship serves as a symbol of resistance and defiance against the dehumanizing forces of totalitarianism.
