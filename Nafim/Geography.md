# Climate Change
### What is Climate change?
Climate change refers to significant and lasting alterations in Earth's climate patterns over an extended period, typically decades to millions of years. These changes are primarily driven by human activities, particularly the release of greenhouse gases (GHGs) such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat, leading to a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect, which results in global warming and subsequent climate changes.
### What causes Climate change?
Several key factors contribute to climate change:
1. **Burning Fossil Fuels**: The combustion of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes releases large amounts of CO2 into the atmosphere. This is the largest contributor to GHG emissions.
2. **Deforestation**: Trees play a crucial role in absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere. Deforestation, primarily for agriculture, logging, and urbanization, reduces the number of trees available to absorb CO2, leading to higher levels of atmospheric CO2.
3. **Agricultural Activities**: Agricultural practices such as livestock farming and rice cultivation produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Additionally, the use of fertilizers releases N2O into the atmosphere.
4. **Industrial Processes**: Certain industrial processes, such as cement production and chemical manufacturing, emit GHGs as byproducts.
### Why is Climate change bad?
The consequences of climate change are widespread and varied, affecting both natural systems and human societies:
1. **Rising Temperatures**: Global temperatures have been steadily increasing, leading to heatwaves, melting ice caps and glaciers, and rising sea levels.
2. **Extreme Weather Events**: Climate change intensifies weather patterns, leading to more frequent and severe storms, floods, droughts, and wildfires.
3. **Impact on Ecosystems**: Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns disrupt ecosystems, leading to habitat loss, species extinction, and altered migration patterns.
4. **Effects on Agriculture and Food Security**: Climate change affects crop yields, water availability, and livestock health, threatening food security for millions of people.
5. **Health Risks**: Climate change exacerbates health problems, including heat-related illnesses, respiratory diseases, and the spread of vector-borne diseases.
### How can we stop climate change?
- Increasing energy efficiency
- Increasing usage of renewable energy
- Decreasing usage of non-renewable energy
- Electrification of Industrial processes
- Using efficient transport (Public transport and cycles)
- Tax industries that emit a lot of carbon dioxide
### How can we adapt to climate change?
- More secure infrastructure
- Reforestation
- Diverse agriculture to stock up for catastrophies
### Case studies

#### The Copenhagen Conference
The Copenhagen conference in 2009 was highly anticipated, with numerous international meetings on climate change leading up to it. Despite the significant attendance of over 45,000 participants and 119 Heads of State, expectations for a comprehensive post-2012 agreement were not met. While progress had been made at the technical level in preceding years, key issues such as commitments by industrialized nations, mitigation actions by developing countries, financing, and measurement remained unresolved. At the conference, both the AWG-KP and AWG-LCA presented draft decisions, but disagreements over procedure and organization of work led to stalled negotiations. In parallel, a group of Heads of State negotiated the Copenhagen Accord, a political compromise on climate action, without authorization from the COP. Despite attempts to gain support for its adoption, opposition from several countries resulted in both COP 15 and CMP 5 merely "taking note" of the Accord. Mandates for the AWG-LCA and AWG-KP were extended, with a directive to complete their work for adoption at the next climate talks in Mexico. The progress made by the COP was summarized in the "COP text."
#### The Paris Agreement
The Paris Agreement, reached on December 12, 2015, marked a significant milestone in global efforts to address climate change. With the attendance of 150 presidents and prime ministers, as well as representatives from various sectors including industry leaders and investors, COP 21 was hailed as a success. Key to this success were the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs), which outlined emissions reduction targets submitted by participating countries. Unlike previous agreements like the Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement sets ambitious targets to limit global temperature increase to below 2 degrees Celsius, with efforts to keep it around 1.5 degrees Celsius. Notably, all countries, both developed and developing, are expected to make binding commitments based on their INDCs.

However, despite these achievements, there are areas of uncertainty and concern. The Paris Agreement lacks a legally binding structure for detailed implementation and enforcement, leaving much to be decided in subsequent COP summits. Additionally, while the agreement encourages countries to develop long-term emission reduction strategies, it does not set clear requirements for this. Furthermore, the mobilization of funds, such as the $100 billion per year green climate fund, lacks detailed plans for expanding the donor pool.

In summary, while the Paris Agreement represents a significant step forward in combating climate change, there are uncertainties and challenges ahead. The success of the agreement will depend on the commitment of countries to fulfill their INDCs, as well as ongoing efforts to address the gaps and uncertainties within the agreement's framework.
# Environment and sustainability
### What is sustainability 
Sustainability entails safeguarding Earth and its resources to support current and future life, including humans, animals, and plants. It is our responsibility to preserve the planet for the well-being of future generations.
