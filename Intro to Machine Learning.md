### Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning
---
##### What is Machine learning?
Machine Learning : Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn something without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Common machine learning algorithms:
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning

Common applications:
- Binary filtering (Filtering a dataset into two categories)
- Speech recognition
- Machine translation
- Online advertising
- Computer vision
##### Supervised learning
The algorithm is first trained based on correct answers given to it. The algorithm then learns to classify an input into pre-determined categories.  
##### Unsupervised learning
Instead of the training dataset being already labelled into categories, unsupervised learning categorizes a dataset into related categories. Unsupervised learning is used to find patterns in datasets
