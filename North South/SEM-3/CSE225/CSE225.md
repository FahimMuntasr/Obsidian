### Data 
Defined as **sets of values**, where a single unit of value/fact is referred to as a **data item**.

Single data items are called **elementary items**, data items that are a collection of elementary items are called **group items**

### Information
Defined as data that is organized according to some meaningful relation, usually thro. This is usually referred to as **processed data**.

Data is said to be **correctly** processed when:
- It arrives on **time**
- It is **accurate**
- It is **complete**


### Data Structures
Storing information in a specific way according to a meaningful relation such that **efficient** and **effective** use of the data is possible. 

An efficient data structure uses the minimum amount of memory and minimum amount of time to fetch data

##### **Types of Data Structures**
- Primitive Data Structures : Basic data types that are usually built into a language.
	- Integer
	- Float
	- Character
	- Pointers
- Non Primitive Data Structures : Built using primitive data types
	- Linear Lists: Location of an element is defined by its order
		- Arrays
		- Stack
		- Queue
		- Linked List
	- Non-Linear Lists: Location of an element is defined by it's neighboring elements and it's hierarchy  
		- Graph
		- Trees

##### **Characteristics of Data Structures**
- Homogeneous - Consists of elements of the same data type 
- Non-Homogeneous - Consists of elements of different data types
- Static - Memory is allocated at compilation time, fixed size
- Dynamic - Memory is allocated at runtime, variable size

##### Arrays
An array is a **static** **linear** list containing a set of **homogeneous** elements. 
A single fixed memory chunk is allocated to an array on compilation

##### Linked Lists
A linked list is a **dynamic** **linear** list where an element along with its own data, contains the memory address of the next element. 
Unlike arrays, the size of a linked list is variable.

##### Stacks
A stack is a specialized array where both insertion and deletion operations can be done only from the top of the stack. **LIFO** (Last in, First out) 
**PUSH** : Inserting an element to the top of the stack
**POP** : Removing an element from the top of the stack
##### Queue
A queue is a specialized array where insertion if done from the end of the queue and deletion is done from the top of the queue. **FIFO** (First in, First out)
##### Trees
A tree is a non-linear data structure where elements are identified by their hierarchical relationships between each other. The top-most element of a tree is called the Root of the tree.

##### Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure defined by a set of vertices and set of edges
![[CSE225 2025-01-26 22.04.38.excalidraw|500]]

##### Abstract Data Type
**ADT** are concepts/models that represent a data structure. The type of data stored and the allowed operations are specified

### Algorithms
An Algorithm is a procedure that takes **data** as input and provides a correct **output** within a finite **time** 

Algorithms are usually specified in :
- English
- Pseudocode
- Computer program

### Common types of algorithms
- Recursive 
- Backtracking 
- Divide and conquer 
- Dynamic programming
- Greedy
- Branch and bound
- Brute force
- Randomized

### Common types of problems
- Sorting
- Searching
- Shortest paths
- Minimum spanning tree
