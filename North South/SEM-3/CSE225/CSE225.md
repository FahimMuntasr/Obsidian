### Data 
Defined as **sets of values**, where a single unit of value/fact is referred to as a **data item**.

Single data items are called **elementary items**, data items that are a collection of elementary items are called **group items**


### Information
Defined as data that is organized according to some meaningful relation, usually thro. This is usually referred to as **processed data**.

Data is said to be **correctly** processed when:
- It arrives on **time**
- It is **accurate**
- It is **complete**


### Data Structures
Storing information in a specific way according to a meaningful relation such that **efficient** and **effective** use of the data is possible. 

An efficient data structure uses the minimum amount of memory and minimum amount of time to fetch data





##### **Types of Data Structures**
- Primitive Data Structures : Basic data types that are usually built into a language.
	- Integer
	- Float
	- Character
	- Pointers
- Non Primitive Data Structures : Built using primitive data types
	- Linear Lists: Location of an element is defined by its order
		- Arrays
		- Stack
		- Queue
		- Linked List
	- Non-Linear Lists: Location of an element is defined by it's neighboring elements and it's hierarchy  
		- Graph
		- Trees



##### **Characteristics of Data Structures**
- Homogeneous - Consists of elements of the same data type 
- Non-Homogeneous - Consists of elements of different data types
- Static - Memory is allocated at compilation time, fixed size
- Dynamic - Memory is allocated at runtime, variable size

##### Arrays
An array is a **static** **linear** list containing a set of **homogeneous** elements. 
A single fixed memory chunk is allocated to an array on compilation

##### Linked Lists
A linked list is a **dynamic** **linear** list where an element along with its own data, contains the memory address of the next element. 
Unlike arrays, the size of a linked list is variable.
##### Stacks
A stack is a specialized array where both insertion and deletion operations can be done only from the top of the stack. **LIFO** (Last in, First out) 
**PUSH** : Inserting an element to the top of the stack
**POP** : Removing an element from the top of the stack
##### Queue
A queue is a specialized array where insertion if done from the end of the queue and deletion is done from the top of the queue. **FIFO** (First in, First out)
##### Trees
A tree is a non-linear data structure where elements are identified by their hierarchical relationships between each other. The top-most element of a tree is called the Root of the tree.

##### Graph
A graph is a non-linear data structure defined by a set of vertices and set of edges


##### Abstract Data Type
**ADT** are concepts/models that represent a data structure. The type of data stored and the allowed operations are specified

### Algorithms
An Algorithm is a procedure that takes **data** as input and provides a correct **output** within a finite **time** 

Algorithms are usually specified in :
- English
- Pseudocode
- Computer program

### Common types of algorithms
- **Recursive:**
    - Recursively breaks down the problem into simpler subproblems and starts solving the smallest cases first.
- **Backtracking:**
    - In problems where decision making is important, a backtracking algorithm keeps making a decision until it reaches a wrong answer/dead end. When it does reach a dead end, the algorithm backtracks to the previous decision and makes the other choice. This is done until the correct answer is reached.
- **Divide and conquer:**
    - Splits the problem into smaller independent subproblems, solves each recursively, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem.
- **Dynamic programming:**
    - Solves problems by breaking them into overlapping subproblems, solving each only once, and storing the results to avoid redundant computations.
- **Greedy:**
    - Makes a series of locally optimal choices, hoping that they lead to a globally optimal solution. It works best when a greedy choice always leads to an optimal solution.
- **Branch and bound:**
    - Used for optimization problems, systematically explores all possible solutions while pruning branches that cannot lead to better results than the current best-known solution.
- **Brute force:**
    - Tries all possible solutions without any optimization, ensuring the correct answer but often being inefficient for large inputs.
- **Randomized:**
    - Uses randomization to make decisions during execution, often leading to probabilistic solutions that can be faster or simpler than deterministic approaches.
### Analysis of algorithms
The efficiency of an algorithm is represented by :
- Time Complexity:
	- Assuming all single operations take the same time, the time complexity of an algorithm is measured by counting the number of operations.
	- Written in Big-O notation O(n) where n is the input size,
- Space Complexity: Amount of memory an algorithm uses

| Complexity     | Example Algorithm                     | Growth Rate |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **O(1)**       | Array indexing                        | Constant    |
| **O(log n)**   | Binary search                         | Logarithmic |
| **O(n)**       | Linear search                         | Linear      |
| **O(n log n)** | Merge Sort                            | Quasilinear |
| **O(n²)**      | Bubble Sort                           | Quadratic   |
| **O(2ⁿ)**      | Exponential algorithms (Backtracking) | Exponential |
| **O(n!)**      | Brute force permutations              | Factorial   |
