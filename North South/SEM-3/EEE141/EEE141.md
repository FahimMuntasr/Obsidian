- Free electrons (usually from the outermost shell of an atom) carry charge
- Current is the Rate of flow of charged particles $$I = \frac{Q}{t}$$
- Types of current
	- DC (Direct Current) : Output current constant over time
	- AC (Alternating Current) : Output current fluctuates up and down over time
- Voltage is the energy required to displace a unit charge through a circuit.
 $$v=\frac{W}{q}$$
- Types of Materials 
	- Conductors : Charge can freely move from one atom to neighboring atoms
	- Insulator : Resists movement of charge
	- Semi-conductors : Resistance greater than traditional conductors but also lower than traditional insulators 
- Types of circuit components
	- Passive : Absorb power/energy
	- Active : Deliver power/energy
- Resistance across two points is the ratio between the potential difference and current$$R=\frac{v}{i}$$
- Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance$$G=\frac{1}{R}=\frac{i}{v}$$
- Resistance is proportional to length and inversely proportional to cross-sectional area$$R=\rho\frac{l}{A}$$
- Ohms law states that potential difference/voltage across a component is proportional to current flowing through it, assuming temperature remains constant$$v=iR$$
- Power is the rate of change of energy$$p=\frac{W}{t}=\frac{W}{q}\times\frac{q}{t}=vi$$

- Circuit terminology
	- Branch$(b)$: Single elements
	- Nodes$(n)$: Points where atleast two branches connect
		- Binary nodes : Nodes that connect only two branches
		- Primary/True nodes : Nodes that connect more than two branches
	- Loop$(l)$: Closed path in a circuit
	- $b=l+n-1$
- Types of connections
	- Series: Elements are in series when they only share binary nodes
		- Current stays constant 
		- Voltage varies
		- Total Resistance : $R_T = R_1 + R_2 + R_3+ ... +R_N$
	- Parallel: Elements are in parallel when they are connected between the same primary nodes
		- Current varies
		- Voltage stays constant
		- Total Resistance : $\frac{1}{R_T}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+...+\frac{1}{R_N}$
- Kirchhoff's laws
	- Kirchhoff's Current Law (KCL) : Net current entering a node is $0$, in other words current entering a node must be equal to current exiting that node.
	- Kirchhoff's Voltage Law (KVL) : Net voltage around a closed loop is 0, in other words all of the energy provided by an active component must be used up by all passive components in a loop.  
- Voltage regulation
	- Power lost due to internal resistance of a cell,$$\%\text{ regulation} =\frac{V_{NL}-V_{FL}}{V_{NL}}\times100$$

$$R_1=\frac{R_b\cdot R_c}{R_a+R_b+R_c}\;\;\;;\;\;\; R_a=\frac{R_1R_2+R_1R_3+R_2R_3}{R_1}$$
$$R_2=\frac{R_a\cdot R_c}{R_a+R_b+R_c}\;\;\;;\;\;\; R_b=\frac{R_1R_2+R_1R_3+R_2R_3}{R_2}$$
$$R_3=\frac{R_a\cdot R_b}{R_a+R_b+R_c}\;\;\;;\;\;\; R_c=\frac{R_1R_2+R_1R_3+R_2R_3}{R_3}$$
