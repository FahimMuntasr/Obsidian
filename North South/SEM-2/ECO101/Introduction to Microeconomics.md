# Markets
Market is a group of buyers and sellers
- Buyers determine the demand 
- Sellers determine the supply 
Competitive markets
- The goods offered for sale are all exactly the same
- Single buyers or sellers have little influence over the market price
# Demand
Demand
- Willingness and ability to buy a certain quantity of goods
- Price is inversely proportional to demand$$P\propto\frac{1}{D}$$
Shifters of Demand
- Income
	- For normal goods ; Directly proportional
	- For inferior goods ; Inversely proportional 
- Price of related goods
	- For substitutes ; The demand for a good decreases when the demand for its substitute increases and vice versa
	- For complements ; The demand for a good decreases when the demand for its complement decreases and vice versa
- Expectation
	- If consumers expect an increase in price in the future, they will increase current demand and vice versa
- Number of buyers
	- Increase in number of buyers increases market demand
# Supply
Supply
- Willingness and ability to sell a certain quantities of goods
- Price in directly proportional to demand$$P\propto D$$
Shifters of Supply
- Cost of production
	- When the cost of production increases, the supply of the goods decreases
- Technology
	- Advances in technology that can lower production costs increases the supply of goods
- Expectation
	- If producers expect an increase in price in the future, they may reducing present supply
- Number of Sellers
	- Increase in number of sellers increases market supply
# Equilibrium
Equilibrium
- When supply and demand is equal
- When market price is above equilibrium a surplus develops
- When market price is below equilibrium a shortage develops
Price Ceiling: Legal maximum on the price at which a  
good can be sold is called a price ceiling.
Price floor: Legal minimum on the price at which a good  
or a service can be sold.
# Taxes
A tax is a mandatory financial charge imposed by a government 
Tax incidence is the proportion of tax burden shared among participants in a market

Taxation on sellers:
- Demand stays unchanged as buyers are unaffected
- Supply decreases as suppliers make less money
Taxation on buyers:
- Demand decreases as buyers have to pay more
- Supply stays unchanged as suppliers are unaffected

Consumer surplus 
	Difference between the maximum price a consumer is willing to pay and the actual price they pay (in other words the value they gained by buying at equilibrium price)
Producer surplus
	Difference between the minimum price a supplier is willing to sell at and the actual price they are selling for (in other words the value they gained by buying at equilibrium price)

Normally selling at prices other than the equilibrium price would result in one party losing surplus or value in the transaction and the other party gaining surplus or value in the transaction.
This is not true when taxes are imposed, as both producers and suppliers lose value in the consumer, the lost surplus is called deadweight loss 
# Elasticity 
Elasticity is a measure of the responsiveness of the quantity demanded or quantity supplied to changes in one of its determinants.

Types of elasticity
- Elastic: a small change leads to a proportionally larger change in quantity demanded or supplied. (>1)
- Inelastic: changes in variables like price, income, and price of related goods result in proportionally smaller changes in quantity demanded or supplied.(<1)
- Unit Elasticity: when the change in quantity demanded or supplied is proportionally equal to the change in price (=1)

Types of elasticity of Demand
- Price Elasticity of Demand
	$$PED = \frac{\%\triangle demand}{\%\triangle price}$$
	$$PED=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{\frac{Q_2+Q_1}{2}}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{\frac{P_2+P_1}{2}}}$$
	
- Income Elasticity of Demand
	$$YED = \frac{\%\triangle demand}{\%\triangle income}$$$$PED=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{\frac{Q_2+Q_1}{2}}}{\frac{I_2-I_1}{\frac{I_2+I_1}{2}}}$$
- Cross Price Elasticity of Demand
	$$XED_{A,B} = \frac{\%\triangle demand\;of\;A}{\%\triangle price\;of\;B}$$$$PED=\frac{\frac{Q_{A2}-Q_{A1}}{\frac{Q_{A2}+Q_{A1}}{2}}}{\frac{P_{B2}-P_{B1}}{\frac{P_{B2}+P_{B1}}{2}}}$$
- Price elasticity of Supply
	$$PES=\frac{\%\triangle supply}{\%\triangle price}$$
	$$PES=\frac{\frac{Q_2-Q_1}{\frac{Q_2+Q_1}{2}}}{\frac{P_2-P_1}{
\frac{P_1+P_2}{2}}}$$
Tax burden falls on the side of the market that is inelastic
	If demand is inelastic, buyers get the tax burden
	If supply is inelastic, sellers get the tax burden
Price elasticity of demand and revenue
	Demand inelastic: Revenue increases with price 
	Demand elastic: Revenue decreases if price increases
	Demand unit elastic: Revenue remains constant
Applications of elasticity
- Pricing strategy
- Revenue collection
- Tax Policy
- Market analysis
- Consumer Behavior Insights
