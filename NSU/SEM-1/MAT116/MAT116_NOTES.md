## Week 1 Part 1
#### Types of numbers
--> Imaginary numbers ( i , $\sqrt{-1}$ )
--> Complex numbers ( 1 + 3i)
--> Real numbers
	--> Rational numbers ($\frac{1}{4}$ , 1 , 1.4)// Numbers that can be expressed as a simple fraction
		--> Fractions ($\frac{1}{7}$, $\frac{7}{2}$, $\frac{1}{3}$) // A way of representing the ratio between two numbers
			--> Integers (-$\infty$ , ... , -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., $\infty$)
				--> Whole numbers (0, 1, 2, 3, ..., $\infty$)
					--> Natural numbers (1, 2, 3, ..., $\infty$)
	--> Irrational numbers ($\sqrt{2}$ , $\pi$ )  // Numbers that cannot be expressed as a simple fraction 
#### Cartesian coordinate system
The x coordinate of a point is called its *abscissa*
The y coordinate of a point is called its *ordinate*
#### Formula for finding the distance between points
If D is the distance between two points A (x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and B (x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>);
##### D(A, B) = $\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2+(y_2 - y_1)^2}$

#### Formula for finding the midpoint between two points
If point M (x,y) is the midpoint of the line connecting points P<sub>1</sub>(x<sub>1</sub>,y<sub>1</sub>) and P<sub>2</sub>(x<sub>2</sub>,y<sub>2</sub>);
##### M -> (x,y) = ($\frac{x_2 + x_1}{2}$ , $\frac{y_2 + y_1}{2}$)
