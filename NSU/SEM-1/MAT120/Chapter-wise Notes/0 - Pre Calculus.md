### Functions
##### Definition of functions
A function is a rule that provides a unique output for each input. When the input is denoted by x, output is denoted by f(x).
A function can be:
- ONE to ONE - one input for one output ($y = x$)
- MANY to ONE - Many inputs for one output ($y = x^2$)
A function cannot be ONE to MANY - one input for many outputs ($x^2 + y^2 = 1$) 
##### Variables
There are two types of variables in a function ; dependent and independent.
Independent variables are free to change and dependent variables are not. Independent variables are the input of a function and dependent variables are the output. 
##### Properties of absolute functions
1. $|-a| = |a|$
2. $|ab| = |a||b|$
3. $|\frac{a}{b}| = \frac{|a|}{|b|} , b \neq 0$
4. $|a + b| \leq |a| + |b|$
##### Domain and range
The domain of a function is the set of values of $x$ for which the corresponding output $y$ is defined and real.
The range of a function is the set of values of $y$ for which the corresponding.
