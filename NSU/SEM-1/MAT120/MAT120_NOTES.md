## Week 1 Part 1
### Functions
##### Definition of a function
A **Function** *f* is a rule that connects a unique output with each unique input 
If the input is labelled *x* ,then the output is denoted by *f*(x)
The input of a function (which is *x* in this case) is always the **independent** variable as it is free to change. Similarly, the output of a function is always the **dependent** variable as it is dependent on the input value

Functions can have one input for one output
                 OR
Functions can have two inputs for one output
				BUT
Functions can NOT have one input with two outputs 
##### Representing functions
Common methods for representing a function are:
- Using a table with inputs and corresponding outputs
- Algebraic notation
- Geometric visualization



##### Absolute functions
$|-a|$  = $|a|$
$|ab|$ = $|a|$ $|b|$ 
|$\frac{a}{b}$| = $\frac{|a|}{|b|}$ , $b$ $\neq$ 0
|$a$ + $b$| $\leq$ |$a$| + |$b$|
##### Domain and Range
The set of all allowable inputs is called the ***domain*** of the function
The set of all allowable outputs is called the ***co-domain*** of the function
	Not all elements of a co-domain have a corresponding input , this means that the number of elements in the range of a function is ***always*** less than or equal to the number of elements in the co-domain of a function
The set of all outputs with a corresponding input is called the ***range*** of the function

## Week 1 Part 2
#### Combining functions

$(f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)$
$(f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)$
$(fg)(x) = f(x)g(x)$
$(\frac{f}{g})(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$
