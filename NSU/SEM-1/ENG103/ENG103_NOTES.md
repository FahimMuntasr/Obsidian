## Week 1 Part 1
#### Composing a paragraph 
Most paragraphs should start with a topic sentence. A topic sentence can be thought of as a ***brief summary*** of the rest of the paragraph.
A topic sentence should :
- Be straight forward
- Hook the reader's attention
- Be the first line in the paragraph (Not always true)
- State a specific subject
The body of the paragraph should have ***unity*** by providing ***supporting*** ***details*** for every point you make. The number of examples given to prove your point should also be ***sufficient*** and ***reasonable*** to achieve ***adequate development***. Sentences should have ***coherence*** both within and between them.
