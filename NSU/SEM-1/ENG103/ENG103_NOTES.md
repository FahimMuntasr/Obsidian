#### Composing a paragraph 
Most paragraphs should start with a topic sentence. A topic sentence can be thought of as a brief summary of the rest of the paragraph.
A topic sentence should :
- Be straight forward
- Hook the reader's attention
- Be the first line in the paragraph (Not always true)
- State a specific subject
The body of the paragraph should have unity by providing supporting details for every point you make. The number of examples given to prove your point should also be sufficient and reasonable to achieve adequate development. Sentences should have coherence both within and between them.
