# SELECTION
----
##### 1. Write a C program that takes an integer input and determines whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

##### 2. Create a program that reads two integers and prints the larger one using a conditional statement (if-else).
##### 3. Develop a C program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation given the coefficients a, b, and c.
##### 4. Write a program to find the maximum of three numbers using nested if-else statements.
##### 5. Implement a C program that reads a character and determines whether it's a vowel or a consonant using a switch statement.
