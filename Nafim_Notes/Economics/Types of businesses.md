## What is a firm?

A firm is a *unit of management* but you can also think of it as a <u>team</u> of people. Like a group project in class, but instead of aiming for a good grade, their <u>goal is to make money</u>. Each person in the firm has a specific <u>role</u>, whether it's designing products, making them, or selling them. 

Just like in a group project where everyone's contribution matters, each person's job in a firm is <u>crucial</u> for its success. Whether it's a small local business or a big company like Nike, firms bring together different talents and skills to <u>provide products or services and turn a profit</u>.
